## This is the biggest lesson in the Bootcamp until now!
 There are a LOT of differente new concepts in this module.

## Clima app is a basic Temperature app, where you type the city you want the information, and it returns to you the temperature and an icon, that indicates the current weather at the desired place.

## What I learned with this project:

* How to create a dark-mode enabled app.
* How to use vector images as image assets.
* Learn to use the UITextField to get user input. 
* Learn about the delegate pattern.
* Swift protocols and extensions. 
* Swift guard keyword. 
* Swift computed properties.
* Swift closures and completion handlers.
* Learn to use URLSession to network and make HTTP requests.
* Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols. 
* Learn to use Grand Central Dispatch to fetch the main thread.
* Learn to use Core Location to get the current location from the phone GPS. 

## This is a project from the iOS development bootcamp, taught by Angela Yu :)
